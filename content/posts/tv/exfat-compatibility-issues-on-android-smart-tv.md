Modern Smart TVs, especially Android-based ones, often allow users to plug in external storage like SSDs or USB drives. However, many users face a common problem: the TV doesn't recognize drives formatted with exFAT. This article explains why that happens and how to solve it by formatting your drive to FAT32 using the terminal on Arch Linux.

## Why Doesn't exFAT Work on Some Android Smart TVs?
While exFAT is a modern file system that supports large files (over 4GB) and large storage capacities, not all Android Smart TVs support it. Here's why:

* **Licensing Issues**: exFAT is a proprietary file system developed by Microsoft. Some device manufacturers avoid paying for its license and thus donâ€™t include support.

* **Limited OS Features**: Budget or older Android TV models may use a minimal Android OS that lacks the necessary drivers for exFAT.

## Use FAT32 Instead
Although FAT32 has a 4GB-per-file limit, it's often the most compatible choice for TVs, game consoles, and legacy systems. If you're using Arch Linux, you can easily format your SSD or USB drive to FAT32 using the terminal.

## Solution
* Identify the Drive:
   * ```shell
      lsblk
      ```
Locate your drive (e.g., /dev/sdb). Make sure you select the correct partition to avoid data loss.

* Install the Required Tool:
   * ```shell
      sudo pacman -S dosfstools
      ```
This installs the `mkfs.fat` command, which formats drives to FAT12/16/32.

* Format the Drive:
   * ```shell
      sudo mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sdb -n "SSD"
      ```

`-F 32`: ensures FAT32 format.

`-n SSD`: sets the drive label (optional).

Replace `/dev/sdb` with your actual partition.

## Conclusion
If your Android Smart TV doesn't recognize your exFAT-formatted drive, formatting it to FAT32 is a reliable workaround. Although FAT32 has limitations, it's widely supported and works seamlessly with most Smart TVs. Arch Linux users can easily format to FAT32 with just a few terminal commands.
