Arch Linux is known for its cutting-edge rolling release system, but that often comes with the risk of updates breaking your system. If you're a new user, encountering a black screen or non-functional graphical interface after a system update can be alarming especially if you don't know how to perform a downgrade.

Fortunately, you can safely restore your system using the Arch Linux Archive and access to a TTY (terminal interface).

## Step-by-Step Downgrade Using TTY
* **Access TTY**
  * Even if your GUI doesn't load, you can usually still access a TTY.
  * Press Ctrl + Alt + F1, F2, F3, etc., to switch to a terminal.
  * If successful, youâ€™ll get a login prompt. Log in with your regular user or root credentials.

* **Edit the pacman.conf File**
  * We're going to force pacman to use a previous snapshot of Arch Linux packages.
  * Edit the config using a terminal text editor like nano:
  `sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf`
  * Then append or modify the repository section to match a specific snapshot date from the official Arch Linux Archive:

  ```conf
  [core]
  SigLevel = PackageRequired
  Server=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2025/05/08/$repo/os/$arch

  [extra]
  SigLevel = PackageRequired
  Server=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2025/05/08/$repo/os/$arch

  [community]
  SigLevel = PackageRequired
  Server=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2025/05/08/$repo/os/$arch
  ```
  
> In this example, we're using May 8, 2025 as the rollback date. You can choose another date if needed.

* **Update and Downgrade All Packages**
  * Now, run the following command to synchronize the package database and downgrade all installed packages to the specified date:
  ```shell
   sudo pacman -Syyuu
   ```
- `-Syy` forces a refresh of all package databases.
- `-uu` downgrades packages to match the specified snapshot.

* Reboot the System
Once the downgrade is complete, reboot the system:

   * ```shell
      reboot
      ```
      
## Conclusion
Downgrading Arch Linux using the Archive is a powerful way to recover from a bad update especially when you can't access the GUI. As a new user, this may seem daunting, but with TTY access and a few careful steps, your system can be restored in minutes.
